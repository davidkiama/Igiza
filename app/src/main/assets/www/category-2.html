                    <p>
                        A very senior bachelor, in his late thirties had requested me to pass by 
                        at least nijue kwenye anaishi coz he was new here na ni mtu wa home. He 
                        had been transferred here by a certain security firm, in fact he was new 
                        in the firm too. This was his first assignment.I had told him I'd be going 
                        to town but he insisted coz he was offduty and even suggested that I should 
                        tag him along, at least aone ferry tena na ajue town kidogo.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So we went to his place with a colleague, we were attending a workshop in 
                        town, sat kidogo to wait for him prepare so that we go together. Hiyo plot 
                        ilikuwa na single bathroom na line ilikuwa hapo, hangengoja coz he was going 
                        to waste our time.Akatuambia tukae hapo kwa verandah aoge chap chap hapo kwa 
                        keja ndio tuende. Ok.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Within five mins he was done na hapo ndio vituko zikaanza!
                        Jamaa pulled from under his bed a stinking boiling sufuria of ugali. 
                        Yaani sijui alipika lini na akasoak hiyo sufuria, imekaa mpaka imeanza 
                        kuferment. He stirred the contents which included juala ya sukuma na mfupa 
                        to unleash the most unpleasant stench which could set your stomach running 
                        instantly. Akatoka nayo nje akaisplash huko, akarudi na sufuria na kutumbukiza 
                        kwa ile maji alikuwa ameogea ikabaki! Yack!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dude went ahead and washed utensils in that water in the very same basin and rinsed them.
                        Nobody talked, we just stared at each perplexed. Huyu ni wa wapi tena??
                        I don't think if I can drink water from this dude's crib, never!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Akavaa shati akachukua spray akajispray, smiling and muttering something like 
                        jasho ya coast na vile hajazoea. Atleast a man should smell nice, saying hiyo 
                        spray alipewa na beste yake huko job kwao. We looked at each other waiting for the inevitable.
                        Spray enyewe ilikuwa ile Tropikal ya choo! That tall purplish tin you spray in the loo to 
                        maintain some odour in the house. We started laughing but seeing the way he was excited about 
                        going to town, he didn't realize what we were laughing about, maybe he thought he had upped his game.
                        Wacha tuingie kwa gari, weee. That thing has a very strong scent, kitambo tufike ferry I had already 
                        developed sore throat and a running nose. It was choking literally.It was our fault anyway, we didn't tell him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We had to go with him hadi kwa hiyo meeting atungoje hapo reception akiwatch tv na kusoma 
                        gazeti hadi tumalize.Kitambo tumalize it was past two, tukamchukua tuende lunch which was 
                        organized there already, a buffet.Kawaida buffet watu hupewa platters, zile kubwa ndio userve 
                        ukiendanga.Personally, I don't stack all junk on offer, I set my mind that am eating one meal, 
                        period. Kama ni chapo nyama ni hivo, basi!This guy ni kama hajawai kula vitu kaizi. He was 
                        standing between us in the line. Budda, jamaa scooped from every chaffing dish na sio eti kidogo 
                        kidogo, mpaka ikabaki sahani ndio ndogo.He followed me to the table, put his food there and left, 
                        I thought he was looking for something, kumbe amerudi kwa line eti sahani ilijaa kabla achukue kuku 
                        fry. I almost stood up to follow him aache ujinga.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Umewai angalia mtu na ile jicho la kumkanya lakini hataki kujua! I took my food and migrated to 
                        another table, nikajifanya hata simjui. Surprisingly, he cleared both and at a very good speed, 
                        not to be left behind when everybody was through.After the demolition, I went over to him, gave 
                        him two hundred shillings and told him to find his way back home, I pretended I had some business 
                        to sort elsewhere.He has not called me since then, next time I'll not take him to town, sai 
                        anajua huko, aende mwenyewe, silly!That was last Friday, I hope hayuko hapa kwa village, there 
                        has been an influx of new villagers of late, you never know.

                        Kumbe hawa masponsors huwanga devil worshippers..
                        I came to nai from ocha kutafuta vibarua hapa Kule as well as kuexplore hii Kenya. 
                        I was really eager to know more about this city. And yes I knew it very well. 
                        I stayed with my aunt and her daughter for a few days nikisakanya wera,wakaanza 
                        madharau uzuri nilikuwa nimepata kakibarua, nikahamia lodging ama ndio rooms hapo 
                        tao kuna mahali I used to pay 200 Bob a night halafu naamka naenda job. For 2weeks 
                        nikitafutanga mahali ningepata single room at least nianze maisha. Luckily nikaget nikalipa 
                        rent pesa nilikuwa nayo ikisha.so nikabaki,Mimi na nyumba yangu na manguo kwa suitcase.I

Hata doctor wakashindwa what happened... Wa kusema ati mi ni deacon kwa church yake, i didnt join him am a christian and i go to church...the scripture I know ni bible...Years later, that is juzi tu I bumped into him in some club nikienda kuona one of my friends,akanisa

                <h3 class="story__title">First Campus Love</h3>
                <p class="story__story">
                    <p>
                        Hakuna heartbreak hukuwa devastating kama your first campus love akiwachana 
                        na wewe uanze kumuona akizungushwa campus mzima kama proforma ya mazishi... 
                        Hostel to hostel midfielder. 😩 <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nikijoin campo nilikuwa fresh from high school so mentality ilikuwa bado 
                        ya high school meaning nilikuwa excited kufika place madem wamejaa... 
                        Yaani kila siku unaona dem hujawai ona na wote wameivaa in their own right. 
                        So siku ya orientation maFresha wote tuka gather hall kuambiwa vile campo hu operate, 
                        hall ilikuwa imejaa drip ya Christmas ya the previous year tupu... Unajua mtu 
                        ametoka high school juzi kulingana na vile ame dress. Kwanza hiyo time ndio 
                        dirty jeans na zile jeans zilikuwa zime printiwa guns kila mahali na Tshirt 
                        za 50 Cents ndio zilikuwa zime hit the market. Drip kama mtu anahara akifika kwa choo...😩
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But madem huwa wame dress modest, hawajaji-reveal vile but ngoja week two 
                        after wamekuwa fully introduced kwa mentality ya what campus is... 80% ya 
                        mwili huwa exposed kama kinyambis ya baboon. So nilikuwa nimekaa karibu na 
                        dem flani, wote tunaogopana... Dem ni kama alizaliwa na kiti juu alikuwa 
                        anakaa poa. Yaani alikuwa ameivaa design angekuwa chakula ningedai ni mSupu 😏
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After orientation watu wakaanza kuulizana "Unafanya course gani?" na wale bado 
                        wako fresh from high school life kazi ni kuulizana "Ulikuwa high school"
                        So time ya tea break tukiendea China mkate, nika meet na huyo dem kwa line, 
                        akaniangalia nikamuangalia, nika smile aka smile... Wote tulikuwa shy like 
                        the freshers we are. Tukapanga line pamoja kama wasee wa Super Metro, hapo 
                        ndio anxiety na nervousness huchapa mwanaume, unavaa ucheze kama wewe uanze 
                        conversation... Pick up lines zote zika evaporate kama spirit ya kinyozi 
                        immediately unapakwa after kunyoa 😩
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So nikacheza kama fresher nikamsho "Hii campo ni kubwa" na hapo ndio Convo 
                        ilianza, the next thing I know tumekaa table moja tukikunywa China mkate 
                        so at this point si Shanghai... It was bound to happen. Tukaulizana 
                        course tunafanya, high school tulikuwa, grade tulipata, place tunatoka 
                        ndio tuka kumbuka hatuja ambiana jina... Nikaji introduce officially na 
                        jina zote but dem ni kama alikuwa na jina moja kama Miguna 😩
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After chai dem akadai since hatuna kitu tunafanya the whole day, tupeleke 
                        vikombe alafu tu meet tuchape hiyo campo tour tukuwe familiar na it's 
                        environs incase nadai kunyoa, anataka kushuka, base ya mutura, kibanda na 
                        kosokoso kama hizo
                        Si tuka meet tukapiga laps kadhaa, tukachukua hiyo opportunity kujuana even 
                        more, tukarudi campo jioni akani hug goodbye... Alafu ni ile hug mikono 
                        zinapita nyuma zina shika mabega kama baby carrier meaning una feel 
                        cushioned by boobs 😍
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tukaenda from evening walks to watching late night movies hapo TV 
                        hall alafu namsindikisha ndio niliowe na hug, hug ikageuka peck, 
                        peck ikageuka smooch, smooch ikageuka kiss... Hiyo siku nililala 
                        kama na smile, niki fantasize wedding yetu na honey moon
                        So the following day ilikuwa freshers night, place ilikuwa turned up, 
                        hall ilikuwa imejaa, tuka turn up me and the love of my life 🤡 🤡🤡🤡
                        Nimeshika kiuno kama belt ndio kila mtu ajuwe ni wangu 😏
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ngoma ilikuwa imeshika kama mimba, watu ni kusuguana kwa dancefloor kama 
                        sufuria na steel wool... Usherati ilikuwa hapo ndani inafanya unafikiria 
                        twice kupeleka mtoto campo. Madem walikuwa fresh from high school 
                        walikuwa wanatumia the same focus walitumia kupata straight A's kupata 
                        straight D's kulingana na vile walikuwa wanaji achilia kwa dancefloor... 
                        Kila mtu alikuwa na wake kwa dancefloor, wameshikana kama jam ya Mombasa 
                        road. Maboys walikuwa focused kupata good grades hiyo time walikuwa 
                        introducted kwa high grades
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sisi mapenzi ilikuwa imetushika, kwangu hii ilikuwa a different type of 
                        freedom, kushika dem hivyo na ku dance na yeye at close range ilifanya 
                        ni feel ni kama niko heaven... Dem akadai tu sneak out of the dance. 
                        Ilikuwa saa sita, tukafika hostel yenye na doze, kila mtu alikuwa bado 
                        anatingisha mifupa dunda so tulikuwa na privacy... Tukaanza kushikana 
                        kama homa. Nguo zilikuwa kama samaki juu tulivua
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dem ni kama hakuwa anataka ku-Gillette down on her first migwatos so kama

                <h3 class="story__title">The Mess that is my Life</h3>
                <p class="story__story">
                    <p>
                        I have got to a point where my life is so much messed up to a point of 
                        being meaningless. Born almost 40 yrs ago, I was brought up like every 
                        normal child, went to the usual schools, was number one throughout primary, 
                        performed well to join university for a BSc, got employed and such other 
                        normal things. But that is where my normality ends. I got hooked up with 
                        a girl in uni and we settled together shortly after we graduated. Two kids 
                        later, we were fighting almost every day and one morning, I just woke up, went 
                        to work and never returned home. I got a singo room and a mattress and started 
                        life afresh. Didn't even carry my certificates. I have never returned to them 
                        or heard about them ever since. My daughter should be going to class 5 if am 
                        not wrong. Not sure about my son.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After leaving my family, I started prostituting with a barmaid named Cate 
                        (she later died of AIDS). She even moved in, and just like any normal man, 
                        we started hitting it raw. For some unknown reason, she didnt infect me. 
                        Mwishowe, tukakosana and she moved out and later died. I attended her funeral 
                        and I could see people looking at me with pitiful eyes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then came in my former househelp. Alifutwa job na my former wife, and she 
                        was helpless. A few months later, she was pregnant and I kicked her out. 
                        Lakini alienda na my laptop and some 8K meant for rent. Sijui kama alizaa. 
                        I changed lines na nikahamia Mathare north, so we have never communicated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then came a certain barmaid whose name and face i cant remember. She 
                        used to work in a keg joint. She was living with a sister 9sharing a 
                        bed too) and sometimes we would go to *** in her house, same bed the sis 
                        is sleeping. One time, I ferked the sis (we were all drunk). Asubuhi, 
                        akajua. usitake kuona vita ya watu watatu against one another. Tukakosana. 
                        After some dryspell, some local nijja at a certain pub promised me he would 
                        give me a girl for the night. He knew my place so nikamshow wewe leta msichana 
                        nitakubuyia kegs mbili. She came, but was approx 13yrs old. Ok, nilimfanya 
                        shoti moja (kavu) but before I could pour the second one, I heard a commotion 
                        outside. Guys were saying kuna mtu anaharibu mtoto kwa hio ploti yetu. Mimi 
                        huyo nikajua kumeumana. Somehow, I managed to sneak through the crowd unnoticed 
                        (kama vile yesu alifanya). I never returned to that plot. Nikaskia chifu 
                        ananitafuta, so I moved to mathare hospital. Not as a patient, but a tenant 
                        in one of the doctor's SQ.
                    </p>
                    <p>
  
                        Life there wasnt any dramatic, except that i came home one evening and 
                        found my huse swept clean. kuuliza neighbors wakanishow it was that woman I 
                        had brought home a week earlier. The woman was my mum's age, and we had met 
                        hapo kwa entrance ya hospital as i was coming from work. She told me that 
                        wako na patient huko but she had paid all the money she had and was stranded. 
                        the fisi in me invited her to my place where we ferked till morning. Nikampea 
                        200 aende kwao embu. Riakanau was still operating then, so 200 ilikua mob. 
                        I think she was a con from mathare slums. After kusafishwa kila kitu kwa nyumba, 
                        nikahamia Komarock to start the next chapter in my life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
       
                        Maisha komarock ilikua sawa coz you could chota a mbich from kayole any time. 
                        I had no permanent girl and therefore any could do. Unfortunately, I had lost 
                        meaning in life that despite my 55K salo (back in 2011), I still used to prefer 
                        drinking in dingy joints huko Kioi, and *** the women from those joints. At one 
                        point, niliambukizwa ugonjwa fulani. Sijawai jua ilikua ipi, but I treated it 
                        by dipping my josto in a cup with concentrated dettol solution. After two weeks 
                        of faithfully doing this, i was ok, yaani i no longer had pain when urinating. 
                        I moved to Pangani, vowed to stop dry-frying random chicks, and even got myself 
                        a nice girl alikua mboch wa jirani. One chnristmas season, she was travelling 
                        home huko western and she asked me to escort her and pay her fare, which I had 
                        no problem. Tukaingia matatu, tukashuka town BS, there was that supermarket hapo 
                        opposite, tukaingia for some shopping, etc. The mbich alinibore coz she took so 
                        much stuff and filled a trolley, ati nitalipa. Tukaenda tukapanga line ya cashier. 
                        Three peopl away from being served, i excused myself ati nimesahau kuchukua maji. 
                        That was the last time she saw me. nikaenda shags and by the time she was coming 
                        back in january (if she came), i had moved to kinoo. This was in 2012.

                    <p>
                        After finishing seco in the mid 80s I was young and carefree without a care 
                        in the world, we had moved from ocha afew yrs earlier to the fast growing 
                        Githurai 45, the area was a wilderness, a huge expanse of savannah grassland extending to the horizon, the clayworks company owned by one Njenga Karume was still in operation then. Before we get to the hekaya let me tell you how Githurai was settled. Jomo had given the expansive piece of land to one Ngala Mwendwa as a present for a political favor, Jomo could afford it as he owned all the land along both sides of Thika Road from KBL HQs, the hotcake land in the 60s was the white highlands and as GEMA gobbled up the farms in the white highlands and in the Rift valley then subdivided it and gave it to members, nobody wanted the lower central Kenya plains which were perceived to be dry. All this land that nobody wanted ndio Jomo alikwachu. He gave a slice where K.U. stands today na Ngala akaangukia na akapewa Githurai yote. Apart from KBL, GSU HQs and Kahawa barracks sifikirii kurikua kitu ingine Thika rd. (I stand to be collected). Fast forward 1983. Kenya ikashinda rights za kuhost the All African Games na serikari ikaanza kutafuta itajenga kiwanja ya kimataifa wapi, mdogo mdogo they zeroed in on Ngalas land and as he was in gava he got wind of the story, he swung into action without wasting time, hived of his land into several parcels and sold it to land buying companies like Mwiki, Mwana Mukia, Mwihoko and several others, he reckoned that watu wakiwa wengi hawawes nyanganywa and he was right.

                    <p>
                        The various companies bila kusileki coz of the urgency wakakatakata mbuloti 
                        haraka sana na wakaanza kuuza, in early 1984 a mbuloti was going for 5k 
                        hapo karibu na barabara na huko ndani, yani ndaaaaani ndaaaaaaaaani kabisa 
                        was 3k and that’s how Meria in his early teens found himself in Githurai.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the early days 84 and 85 life was tough in Githu, no running water, 
                        no electricity, hses were few and far between na insecurity was the 
                        order of the day, infact kulikua kwaitwa Githurai Chuma, hardly a 
                        fortnight passed without a murder by thugs. BTW jina 45 came about 
                        coz of the KBS bus number 45, nikiwa jiji mtu akiuliza nilikua naishi 
                        wapi nilikua namwambia Ruiru or Clayworks coz Githurai had a bad name. 
                        In the late late 80s karibu mbuloti zote zilikua zimeuzwa and settlers 
                        were coming in by the day, kazi ya mjei ilikua nyingi sana na ulikua 
                        unachagua ile site utafanya kazi, pay was 40 bob per day.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Hii ilikua pesa nyingi sana ukilinganisha na fare ya kwenda tao which was 1 bob. 
                        Come payday on sato and I would be walking on air, I had no 
                        responsibilities and all that money was mine to spend as I wanted,
                        nilikua nala chakula nyumbani, sikua nalipa nyumba, sikua na bibi, 
                        sikua na kunywa phombe wala kuvuta sigara, sikua na mpango wa kando, 
                        it was just me and my 240 shillings. 140 used to disappear under my 
                        mattress na bakia na 100 ya kushukuru mwili. There were only three bars 
                        in Githurai, 1. Blue congo, 2. Miruri, hapo kwa railway crossing and 3. Gateway club.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Gateway was the place to be for a young man, walikua na modern 
                        discotheque na huku ndio nilikua najipata every Saturday and 
                        Sunday dancing to funk and what you now call soul, kiingilio 
                        ilikua ni 3 bob unapigwa stamp kwa mkono. I was yet to discover 
                        other discotheques in town like Visions, Boomerang na Hollywood 
                        ( @wildfrank you missed this).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It so happened that on one weekend a new tobacco company was in 
                        town, the had hire our disco na kiingirio ilikua free na unapewa 
                        pakiti moja ya SUPERMATCH cigarettes, they had this beautiful 
                        girls ware walikua wanakufungulia pakiti na kukuashia sigara and 
                        like always when I puffed a sigara those day nilikohoa sana na 
                        nikachekwa. During the night amid the music and smoke there were 
                        various contests and games and guess mshindi alikua apewa nini? ….. 
                        Bufa ya sigara as a pack with 20 packets was called. All contestants 
                        in any game walipewa kitu, sijui siku hizo promotions mbona hazikua 
                        na t-shirts, kofia, bags or umbrellas. All we got were cigarettes and 
                        more cigarettes, nikienda home around saa saba ya usiku I had more 
                        than 100 packets of supermatch.

                <h3 class="story__title">Started with a handshake</h3>
                <p class="story__story">
                    <p>
                        Kuna time nilikuwa coast, just after completing my high school, I 
                        decided to take walk, kujua mtaa. I love walking around plus Mombasa 
                        si kama Nairobi, CBD is like a stone throw away.
                        Hiyo time we stayed in Tudor, so I took a backpack nikavaa then I 
                        used the stadium route up to Tononoka Rd into Coast bus junction 
                        (now Hill top plaza) then one way hadi kule Pembe za ndovu. Coastal 
                        people are lazy hata naming streets is a problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Along that Street, Moi avenue I met some two guys, one was fairly 
                        older than the other and they stopped me.
                        We shook hands (first mistake) halafu the old one says ati they are 
                        lost. Turns out they were headed for somewhere but walipoteza vector.
                        I was still acting on my good Samaritan shit so I offered to help them 
                        find their way. Big mistake. Apparently the handshake was the first 
                        wrong move, made me under a stupor of some sort.
                        Si we took a detour hapo Moi avenue, and a few paces ahead the Old man 
                        starts telling me how he sees great problems ahead for me, ati my granny 
                        ameniweka kwa chupa and amazingly enough, I seemed to be in agreement, 
                        despite being a very argumentative person myself.
                        He stopped me, gave me a paper, told me to chew it, for a while. I did 
                        it. I Was hypnotised so much that I didn't know what else to do.
                        The young one didn't do anything but just echo the old man's antics, 
                        I being completely oblivious of their prank.
                        Then he told me that I have a dark family, marred by a history of Voodoo 
                        and if I don't break the cycle I will suffer alot.
                        Halafu ananishow I spit out the paper I was chewing. I did and on opening 
                        it nikaona some strand of hair. I was shocked. I was scared too.
                        Hapo nikajua this nigga is onto something so like a kid I asked him how do 
                        I break the curse.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        He said something that I consider the cheesiest line ever.
                        He told me to leave everything I had with him, place tulikuwa was on the 
                        parking lot of some three storey building. So he said that I go round the 
                        house once then nirudi apo pali they were and the curse would be lifted.
                        it wasn't until I had made the first corner ndo nilirudi back to my element, 
                        dashed back to find the nigga gone plus my bag, which had some photocopied 
                        documents and my phone and 500/- together with the wallet.
                        Just a few metres from where I had left them were some mechanics, I asked 
                        them, they just told me and I quote 'dogo usiamini mtu yoyote hizi sehemu, 
                        hao ni walaghai tupu'
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    
                        I just knew that I had been dealt a good one in broad daylight.
                        So I went home and told my dad and cousin the story and they laughed 
                        at me like though I was mental or something.
                        That's why I am not into handshakes. People are not trustworthy outchea

                        Kumbe mzoga ilidhani yeye ni mjanja lakini inapata evidence ya OCAMPO.
