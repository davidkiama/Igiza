                        I was in high spirits, I had a place to call my own. Never mind 
                        that the only things I owned were a single stool, mattress on the 
                        floor, one pair of bed sheets, a stove without a stand (cooking ugali 
                        on that thing was a gamble), two sufurias, a jua kali pan, two plates, 
                        two cups, two spoons, a knife and two basins for dishes. A leso sufficed 
                        for a curtain, and I had two basins for laundry. The room was small but it 
                        seemed so large for lack of any furniture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I woke up one fine sunday morning and after a weak breakfast got down to doing 
                        my laundry and cleaning my room. I went out and bought two ripe bananas to keep 
                        hunger at bay because I had a grand plan of making a nice meal for myself, it 
                        would be the first meal with any form of meat in that house. My hands and 
                        feet were ashen from the soapy water so I splashed some lotion as I did not 
                        plan to take a shower then. The plan was to get all that I needed to make my meal, 
                        come back and cook then I would take a shower and sit down to enjoy my food feeling fresh.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So I started the walk from Githurai 45 (the butcheries on this side did 
                        not have what I wanted) to go to the other side of Githurai 44. There 
                        was a butchery there past where Equity Bank stands that sold minced meat. 
                        I don’t know if it still exists. The plan was to have minced meat and 
                        peas with rice. I would have preferred the minced meat with chapos, but 
                        since I did not have a decent pan for chapos, rice would do. Me that one 
                        (mimi huyo) passed by market and bought peas, tomatoes and onions. Just 
                        before I crossed the road to 44, I saw this pata potea guys “hii inakula, hii 
                        inapoteza nahii inapoteza”. I watched the guy shuffle the cards and I could tell 
                        which one was to win. Everytime guys placed money on the cards I could tell which 
                        one was to win, and I was correct all the time! Or so I thought. Why were people 
                        winning free cash and I wasn’t? I could double or triple my cash………
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What happened happened. I went back home sun burnt, dusty, thirsty and 
                        without any minced meat. Ilibidi nikule rice na minji plain. I have never 
                        attempted to gamble again!
                    </p>

                        I remember Madam Esther, she was an old lady mid 60's with a calling to be a conlady.
                        A certain pastor , mzee kihara , a slim fella with those mismatching mutumba suit 
                        introduced me to him .Kihara operated a small mabati church in kiandutu thika but 
                        closed it down when he failed to realise miracles are the key to success for any 
                        church to successfully operate in a slim ....so he opted to be selling avocadoes 
                        by zungusharing all over the residence in his black mamba bicycle , n that's how 
                        we got to know each other coz I lived nearby in another slum called Athena , 
                        sijawai jua hiyo jina Athena ilitoka wapi .
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I used to buy at least two avocadoes daily akipita kitu saa moja , ndivyo akajua 
                        Mimi NI Mwalimu . We exchanged different topics till one day akataja huwa 
                        anapeleka avocadoes kwa children home ya madam Esther on Tuesday n wenesday...... 
                        Hehehe now here is where the story begins.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I got an interest to visit this children home n at least take some humanity photos 
                        n post in Facebook , my online friends waone vile Niko na roho ya utu .So we 
                        organised with pastor badia anipeleke huko. Kufika nikapata NI an old plot , 
                        very dirty with very rugged unkept kids some looked like they were suffering 
                        from kwashiokor . The children home had at least 10 kids , age bracket 5yrs to 14 
                        yrs , most from poor families from the slums around .
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I got to learn some had been enrolled in a public school nearby .
                        "Mwalimu u look like a descent n learned fellow , why don't u be inviting 
                        friends over to visit us at least watusaidie kulipa rent na chakula , 
                        I believe God can do wonders, I promise for each member who u bring n 
                        contribute u will be getting a 30% cut of his or their contribution" ...... 
                        She told me.Wow that sound like a good business idea n since I had connection 
                        with many teachers in private sector around the area . In two months time I 
                        had mobilised over 10 groups of different schools to visit the children home. 
                        The minimum contribution a group ever contributed was kshs 20k , in those two 
                        months I had made a clean 30 k kama sijasahau till one day kikaumana.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I remember nilikuwa natokea job chuo , carrying a form 3 klb textbook as I

                        I know some of you have worked for those outfits where the workforce 
                        comprises largely of relatives and a few outsiders who bribed their way through.
                        In these organizations, there's no promotion on merit but how long you've 
                        been working and who is your godfather.These places are always full of 
                        snitches and backstabbing is the norm.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Furthermore, the manager wields so much power and his authority is unquestioned. 
                        His word is law. If he refers you to the Hr, your goose is cooked, no 
                        disciplinary hearing or work ethic procedure. You're gone just like 
                        that. No Union(cotu), maybe you sue them but remember its a family 
                        business and you understand the judiciary system in Kenya, No Money, No Justice!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There's a time I was working for such an organization. The job was so 
                        draining, we clocked in at eight and left after nine, that's thirteen 
                        straight hours. There were no weekly off duties but two days per month 
                        and you had no luxury of choosing which day you wanted. The manager 
                        chose for you, guess if you were not in his good books. Utaenda off 
                        on 23rd and 24th without any money to spend so you end up rotting in 
                        the house watching TV. You can't chase pu**y empty handed you know.
                        Let's leave this here for another day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my department, we were four guys. We were given a target to achieve 
                        which we managed and emerged the best overall countrywide. We were to 
                        be rewarded by our suppliers and this reward was to be strictly for 
                        the four of us and the management.Since most of the manager's right 
                        hand men were not in this category, he decided that we were going to 
                        share the reward with everybody, a matter which we didn't take lightly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So when the money came, it was handed to one of us, I heard it was a 
                        hundred k. The person who brought the money didn't tell the manager 
                        but gave it to one of the guys in our department, he just came like 
                        he was passing by to check how work was going. We didn't expect him 
                        to bring the cash coz he was a junior and we knew the money would have 
                        been taken to the manager's office anyway.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The dude given the money ended up pocketing the whole amount and keeping 
                        quiet. We didn't even suspect anything. We continued waiting for the money, 
                        very patiently not knowing the idiot had spent the whole amount.This guy was a 
                        liberal Corinthian, those who don't wear turbans. At first he was very religious 
                        and reserved when he was brought.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With money flowing and guys socialising only at night due to working late, 
                        he succumbed to peer pressure, started drinking, attending house parties 
                        and ended up marrying a single mother.They used to go out drinking as a 
                        couple with friends and sometimes ended up spending the nights separately 
                        after one too many.There's a day I had gone for an away match somewhere 
                        so I was returning home around five in the morning ndio watu wasinione. 
                        My chic was leading me to the road when I met this dude's wife with 
                        another guy, also from an away game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, my chic was also my colleague and that kunguru knew both of us. 
                        You know the hours we were spending at work meant we had to zero graze and 
                        maybe uangukie client.Hata hatukusalimiana, imagine the guilt.The kunguru 
                        went home, told her husband that she saw us, as if what we saw her doing 
                        was justifiable. Wacha jamaa akuje job na mdomo.By ten o'clock, everybody 
                        knew of our affair. My chic decided she was not going to take that bs and 
                        told the Corinthian guy that his wife was also coming from a guy in her 
                        neighborhood. I liked the reaction. It stung him!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kumbe, she had been banging the guy for quite a while. She had told her 
                        husband that she was going out for a sip with her girlfriends so he was 
                        left home to look after the kid(not his).I don't know what happened in 
                        that house that night but the following day by nine, kunguru was at our 
                        work place, half naked, dusty(I guess she trekked) with her equally dirty 
                        baby by her side screaming obscenities.She was demanding to see the manager.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She revealed that her husband had duped us over a hundred thousand meant 
                        for our reward and that he had been stealing from the company. The 
                        bitch said so many things and caught the attention of everybody. 
                        She spilled the affairs of the company staff, some of which I didn't 
                        even know of.It was so shameful, I was literally shaking and sweating. 
                        The guy had been feeding his kunguru wife with workplace gossip and so 
                        many guys were mentioned. Imagine the feeling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She was whisked away to the manager's office, calmed down and given 
                        something to drink as wazee wa kambi wakaitwa waskize kesi.Guess I was 
                        one of them and the youngest among them. I couldn't even talk, I don't 
                        even know why they chose me to be there in the first place.
                        The guy was summoned and admitted to many of the accusations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Guess what, he was pardoned but demoted to a cleaner with a pay cut.
                        He chased away that kunguru but not before she caused so much drama 
                        and had him locked in a cell for a night.

                        We missed that money just like that and there was nothing we could do about it.

                        is a meru…..Been new in the estate describing the exact location was

                        am in a compound with no perimeter wall , the outside toilet has one of 
                        the doors nearly dislocating from it's hinges , it's just hanging karibu 
                        kuanguka ……The main door two the 3 bedroom house , is open and a voice 
                        calls me behind the carpet ."Umefika ?" She says , opening the curtain 
                        with a walking stick , she is in a wheelchair her legs seem to be having 
                        some problem coz imefura , her voice ain't that good coz shingo naona amefura pia ……

                        burner" she tells me in a jovial manner .Kuingia the place is stuffy , 
                        nanikama ilioshwa 3days ago . I replace the burner with the new cylinder 
                        and watch her unfolding a scarf where the money was tightly folded .She 
                        asks I pick her reading glasses from the table as she struggles to count 
                        the kshs 50, and kshs 100 notes till zinatosha 950/= za kunilipa gas ……
                        "Chukua, now since u have come was wondering Nani nitatuma dukani , ni 
                        saa kumi na Bado sijapika lunch or breakfast since I didn't have any gas"
                         ……she finishes in English as she continues telling me she is a retired 
                         teacher . But her living condition is so sad , she tells me her daughter 
                         didn't come back the previous day to check on her , she is married some 
                         few km away , n she is the one that usually checks on her …….

                        mbili, ripe bananas, na upitie chemist uniletee dicrophena za 20/= " she 
                        hands me kshs 200 as she continues thanking me for showing up …. I can't 
                        say no coz I pitty her situation n feel sorry for , it's 15 mins back to

                        the kitchen table then nimuchotee maji ameze hiyo dicrophena……kumpatia

                        So nikatoka job Eastleigh kitu six hapo, ilikuwa sato. Kama kawa mjei 
                        hufaa kuisha sato by two lakini contractor na ujinga yake, mpaka 
                        apeleke pesa mskitini saa kumi ndio aanze kuzunguka kwa sites, 
                        kitambo tufikiwe ni past six huko, in fact f**k you Yusuf. That 
                        Jaluo was very arrogant, I donno if he's still around...
                        Mimi huyo, Nyalgunga, Mathare valley hapo daraja mbili nikapitia kwa 
                        base ya mandazi nikawai ya fifty bob na nikaongezwa moja kama customer. 
                        Kufika kejani ni strungi chapchap na hizo mandazi kumi na moja zote 
                        ndio nikasema sasa wacha weekend katambe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nilikuwa nimepanga niendee take away Mbuthia, pale John Saga, wakamba 
                        wamejaa huko at a very low cost but first nilikuwa nipike supper. 
                        Budget ilikuwa ni soo tatu, kichwa ya mbuta ya soo na pu**y ya soo 
                        mbili, whole night.So I was debating nipike first ama nikuje 
                        na take away apike labda anaezanipunguzia bei. I decided to 
                        cook, after all si nitamlipa na bado atapata place ya kulala hadi morning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So nikarudi kwa mama samaki, kuna mothee hapo alikuwa akiitwa 
                        Tyson, a very rough luo woman na sura ngumu kama ya mwanaume. 
                        Nikampa mia na nikachagua kichwa ya mbuta. By then, it was already 
                        dark na wakati huo, streetlights hazikuwa mob hivo.Tomato zangu 
                        za mitumba na pilipili ya bob. Bachelor na vitu zake za kununua 
                        gizani nikarudi kwa keja.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So nikaseti fish kwa stove, nikaikaranga vipoooa ndio hiyo supu ikuwe 
                        mzito, nisije nikajiangusha na hiyo pending away game, mnajua tu wakamba 
                        na ngono. I had to eat, unga ni ile ya kisiagi na sio eti nilikuwa naibembeleza.
                        Hapo nyuma ya keja, kuna choo ilikuwa imesetiwa design ya mabati tu mtu alijenga 
                        juu ya manhole na akangoa hiyo cover ya juu, ikawa ni ukikata weight hakuna 
                        cha kuenda na maji ya kuflash, ilikuwa automatic n it was very deep. Hiyo 
                        sewer ilikuwa deep down, so nikaingia hapo nipunguze weight niki ngojea 
                        kichwa ya mbuta iive. At least nicreate space ya supper coz zile mandazi 
                        zilikuwa zimeoccupy kama quarter of my stomach capacity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nikaseti maji ya mbese juu ya hiyo sufuria ingine ya fish, ndio iive poa na 
                        pia kitambo iive, maji ya sembe pia itakuwa imeboil, so ni kutoa fish na 
                        kusonga mbese. It was kinda economical pia, cooking two things at a time, 
                        saving time and money.After nimetoka kupunguza weight, nikakam kuchungulia 
                        hiyo samo kama labda supu imepungua niongeze waba ama side moja imeiva nipindue the other eye.
                        Wacha nitoe hiyo sufuria ya sembe ilikuwa hapo juu!!!! Weee!! Maze harufu 
                        nilikutana nayo, hadi nikadrop hiyo sufuria engine juu ya box yangu ya nguo. 
                        The stench was soo strong.Kumbe msumba alikuwa amenunua muozo, samaki sijui za last week, nkst.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nikachota maji kwa ile cup nilikuwa nimegonga nayo strungi, nikazima nayo hiyo 
                        stove na fujo sana, na hasira zangu zote nikabeba hiyo ghasia na hiyo sufuria 
                        and marched to confront Tyson. And there she was, sitting in her full majesty, 
                        I bet she knew what to expect......

                        aliku invite alafu the rest ni strangers, alafu bash yenyewe na Tanzania 
                        zilikuwa na one thing in common... Pombe 😏
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alafu karibu kila mtu kwa hiyo bash alikuwa mlevi so to be in sync 
                        nilikuwa natembea na chupa ya pombe, nikiona watu wananiangalia 
                        vibaya nanusa chupa ama nachapa sip natembea na pombe kwa mdomo 
                        nikitafta sink niteme😩
                        So msee nilikuja na yeye alikuwa busy ana mingle na watu single akitafta 
                        mtu wa ku unda na yeye family album... In short, nikabaki pekee yangu 
                        looking miserable, confused and awkward 😏
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Food ikaletwa nika realize kitu ilikuwa imeivaa kwa hiyo bash ni madem 
                        pekee... Ni ile food hufai kukula na kukunywa at the same time coz 
                        unaweza jipata umelewa na unaendesha.... Definition ya Don't Drink and drive 😩
                        Kitu 9:30 hapo nikaona dem flani hapo looking lonely and out of place 
                        kama mimi, nikajua hapa nisipo make my move kuna fisi hyena dem mahali 
                        itapita na yeye... Si nikacheza kama mimi nim approach. Dem alikuwa 
                        mweupe pe pe pe, alafu ilikuwa ironic juu mimi nlikuwa na sura ya 
                        ngiri lakini dem ndio ako na rangi ya thao. Alafu ku top up hiyo urembo 
                        alikuwa na dimples aki smile, wale hawajui dimples.. Ni zile potholes za uso 😁
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nikamsalamia, akanisalamia, tukasalamiana, nika anza kumuuliza kama anajua 
                        mwenye bash akanishow hajui mwenye bash yeye amaeleta tu beshte yake 
                        anaitwa "Ann," beshte yake akakuja tukasalamia-Ann-a 😁
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        "What a Kui-ncidence... Niko na beshte anaitwa kui pia" 😁😁 anyways, 
                        enough lame puns let's get back to the story... 😏
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Nikauliza dem kama anapenda jina zake ama nimuongeze yangu ya pili? 
                        dem aka smile coz come to think of it, kuna siku atapewa jina ya 
                        wenyewe apende asipende... The naming ceremony of a girl child is 
                        never over until she gets married. So hapo nikajua niko na one foot 
                        inside her skirt, so trick ni kurusha mistari back to back kama logo 
                        ya kappa... Si nika geuza conversation kuwa "feeling" station, so 
                        kama gas cylinder ya pink nikam-Gas vile she's my Best Lady 😩

                        So kama Mat mpya akili ikaniambia she probably needs manamba... Wanaume 
                        wengine waki save pesa mimi nlikuwa bash na save number za madem 😩
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Bash ikaenda hadi late, watu tulikuja nao ni kama walilewa wakasahau 
                        walikuja na sisi... Dem akadai kwao ni mbali na haoni kama ataget gari 
                        so alikuwa ana plan kuomba mwenye bash kama anaweza lala huko. Nikamsho 
                        no need, niko na kitanda kubwa ya 5 by 6 so asikuwe na wasiwasi coz 
                        hatuwezi finyana 😏 get it... Ndio uende na dem kwako you must come up 
                        with a convincing lie. Dem akakubali tukafika mansion... True to my words 
                        bed ilikuwa ya 5 by 6 but kama Jamaica na Cayman islands tuka caribbean-ana... 
                        Tuka apply the laws of magnetism, unlike poles attract, so tukashikana 🙈
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        But hatukusuguana so sikutoa chuma kutu 😩 tuli cuddle tu tukapeana 
                        heshima zetu... Kitu nilikula tu ni usingizi.
                        Mimi na mtu alilala pekee yake tofauti ilikuwa tu kuamka nikinukia 
                        perfume ya dem juu ya kushikana otherwise mtu alilala pekee atleast alinyonga 
                        nugu 😩
                        Dem aka amka asubuhi with her hymen still intact coz nilijua good things take 
                        time and they cum to those who wait... 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡 Najua ngoja ngoja huumiza 
                        matumbo lakini kama kuna tumaini, you liver alone and wait for the right 
                        time 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Nikamsindikisha hadi kwao like the gentleman I am, tukiongea vitu mob, 
                        tukagusa hadi feelings, akafunguka, nikafunguka, wote tukafunguka kama 
                        milango za kanisa... Nikajua hapa nimepata my better half 🤡 🤡 🤡

                        So two days zikapita hakukuwa na communications juu sikutaka kukaa 
                        desperate, but siku ya tatu nikacheza kama Yesu kwa tomb, nika amua 
                        ku resurrect conversation yetu mahali tuliwachia. Nika amua kumWhatsApp 
                        lakini ni kama alikuwa anadhani niko na asthma coz ni grey ticks tu 
                        nlikuwa nakula, hata ni heri ukule Blueticks juu uta feel kama Celeb 
                        amekuwa verified 😩
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Nikajiambia haina haja ni jam, labda text yangu iko kwa traffic, so ni 
                        poa kutulia ningoje turn yangu coz maybe tuko wengi kwa inbox 😢
                        Wahenga walisema madem si kama margarine udhani umepata BB, wengine ni 
                        Zesta watakuweka kwa Jam... So lazima ungoje wafuate protocol coz madem hu 
                        reply text in the order of importance 😢
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        After 2hours of no response nikakumbuka wahenga walisema mwenye haja 
                        huenda choo, so nikapiga long call but dem harpic call, nikacheza chini 
                        nikijiambia akiona missed call atacheza kama mtu amekata uzani yaani ata 
                        flash. Ni ile moment uko na anxiety attack, unawasha na kuzima data, una 
                        check balance ya bundles unaona bado ziko, una check network unaona iko 
                        full... Unakuwa desperate hadi una feel kukata kata vitungu ndio simu ilie 😢😭

                        So kama Math nika check kuona kama ako Area coz nlikuwa sure when I'm Width 
                        her we can probably talk at Length and solve the problem... Watu wa mazematics 
                        najua hawaja Ng'ang'a-na kushikanisha. Si nika drop by kwao kuona kama ako poa 
                        ama maybe ni mgonjwa, na kama ni mgonjwa amepelekwa intensive care unit nimuulize 
                        "Can I C U??" 😢
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Dem akaniambia si kwa ubaya but she was only looking to have a good time... 
                        Ati she had just come out of a bad break up aka amua kuenda hiyo bash kutoa 
                        tu stress and she's not ready for another relationship... chwest pwains 😢
                        No wonder alikuwa ame post picha yake kwa WhatsApp aka caption "Self love" 💔 😢
                        Nilikuwa na feel kama mtu amefunga saa kwa kiuno coz i waisted my time 😏
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Moral of the story, penda mtu anakupenda... Respect yourself ama utaji 
                        embarraz wewe na your ancestors, your clan and your future generations,

                        Kuna day arif amekuja kuniomba mansion akidai anataka kukulia 
                        porko… yaani nyama haram coz ni msee alikuwa ameoa… na juu marafiki 
                        ni kuokoleana nikamsho haina kelele, mansion atapata. Nikaona si 
                        mbaya mwanaume ku change diet once in a while, anaeza kuwa amechoka 
                        ku-Sukuma Wiki na bibi ama maybe amekuwa na beef na bibi ndio 
                        aka-develop HAM ya kukula Porko. Arif ni wale watu hupenda kukula 
                        Mass, yaani anything that occupies space… so sikutaka ku weigh in kwa 
                        hii issue nijuwe analeta nani, kile aliniambia tu ni ati amepata mchezaji 
                        wa kulipwa na anadai mechi. Nikajipa shugli kuenda kupiga raundi mwenda 
                        mtaani, arif alikuwa amenishow anadai tu 3hours hivi atakua amemaliza 
                        shugli… alikua ashanipea za macho kama None Disclosure Agreement (NDA)! 
                        Nikaamua badala ya kumaliza sol ya kiatu bure nikaona nisimame kwa kibanda 
                        ya kuuza muvi nikijifanya kununua, by the time 4hours zinaisha nlikuwa 
                        nimeona muvi mbili za Dj Afro bure… street smart! Arif akanikol kunisho kuna 
                        shida, dem ni kama amekwama mansion so alikuwa amemuacha akadai niende nimtoe 
                        coz kuna venye wife yake alikuwa amemkol juu kulikua na family emergency.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Nikarudi mansion na intension ya hostile takeover… mansion ilikuwa 
                        inanuka gym; mchanganyiko ya jasho ya makwapa na sehemu nyeti, 
                        Sex hormones, perfume ya dem, cologne ya arif na air freshener. 
                        Nikakaribishwa kwangu na bonge la dem… ilikuwa ni ka nimeingia pork 
                        joint, dem alikuwa na abundance ya fat in all the right places na 
                        wrong places pia. Huyo mukilala na yeye bed ya 4 by 6 lazima mtafinyana. 
                        Nikajua mbona arif ali refer kwa huyo dem kama porko, si juu ni mchezaji 
                        wa kulipwa but ni juu alikuwa na cholesterol… alikuwa amejaza anaeza 
                        fungua WhatsApp group yeye peke yake. Mansion ilikuwa inakaa crime scene, 
                        according to my forensic report, dem ka hakumeza P2 immediately basi kitu 
                        angefaa kuchukua ni P3 huko police station akuwe ready kushika mimba.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Kulingana na vile bed sheets, bed cover, pillow na blanketi zilikuwa all 
                        over the place ilikuwa obvious huyo dem alikuwa ame-Tiwa kama Savage. 
                        Kama mechi ni gambling basi alikuwa amekuliwa. Dem akanisho mwenye nyumba 
                        hayuko ati nirudi baadaye, nikamsho mimi ndio mwenye nyumba na mwenye anadhani 
                        ni mwenye nyumba alikuwa ame hire tu venue ndio a hold hiyo event. Ku clear 
                        the elephant in the room dem akaamua ku call arif ku confirm kama nasema ukweli 
                        but arif alikuwa mteja… it’s either alikuwa amezima phone ama ilikuwa flight 
                        mode ku avoid noma na wife. Ikabidi nime prove ni kwangu, nikamsho chumvi iko 
                        kwa mkebe ya coco, Sukari iko kwa mkebe ya milo, pegs ziko kwa mkebe ya omo, 
                        cd ziko kwa box ya ketepa, mafuta ya taa iko kwa chupa ya Jack Daniels. Bedsitter 
                        ilikuwa crowded na mtu mmoja, nilikuwa na feel ka astronomer … yaani I needed space. 
                        Dem ka huyo unampeleka date kichinjio then unavaa lab coat ya butchery ndio umchinjie 
                        coz ako na nyama.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Nikashow dem acheze kama mtoto ako na kisu, yaani ajikate coz 
                        nadai ku clean up mess yao alafu nitulie after kupigwa exile for more than 
                        3hours… akadai haendi mahali hadi aone arif ama nimpeleke kwa arif. 
                        Nikajua kitumbua kimeingia mchanga, siezi mpeleka kwa arif coz ni ndoa 
                        ntakua navunja na pia siezi allow akae kwangu coz one man’s meat is another 
                        man’s cholesterol… figuratively speaking! Dem akajitupa kwa bed kimandazi 
                        mandazi ndio nika realize ni tisho yangu tu ndio alikuwa amevaa, ndani 
                        alikuwa free kama office WiFi. Ni kama alikuwa amezoeya kufyekwa coz hakuwa 
                        bad & bushy. Nika realize kitu inaeza mtoa kwangu ni reverse psychology, 
                        nikamshow avae nguo nimpeleke kwa arif basi… after all, if you can’t beat 
                        them, enjoyi them. So nikamu-enjoyi coz sikuwa na otherwise! Akavua tisho 
                        yangu akabaki ndethe, yaani kila kitu ilikua in the open na juu mi huwa 
                        allergic kwa madem wako uchi, mjuols ikacheza kama mat kwa stage ya mwisho, 
                        yaani ikasimama. Akavaa panty, bra, skirt inakaa familiar, sharti iko na kitu 
                        ka budge, socks za white ziko na stripes mbili, tuffees, ndio nikajua Things 
                        fall apart si kitabu ya Chinua Achebe pekee…dem alikuwa mwanafunzi! Immediately 
                        mjuols ikaanguka kama bei ya mtumba jioni, nilijua nikipatwa na huyu dem ntakuwa 
                        behind bars na si kama mlevi ama rapper… itakuwa kama mfungwa na charges za defiling 
                        a minor.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Aliye na akili haambiwi tumia, nikajua huyu dem akitoka kwangu akiwa na 
                        uniform ni obvious watanishuku na ntajipata kwa shida na pia ntachoma CV…nikamsho 
                        a-maintain kwanza asitoke nje. Akavaa sweater ku complete the outfit nikajua mimi 
                        na jela ni kama nyama choma na kachumbari, nikauliza dem kama hiyo ni uniform ya 
                        nursing, TTC ama petrol station…akadai ako high school form 2! Kumbe dem si 
                        porko, ni mtoto mwenye account anaeza fungua ni piggy bank account pekee… 
                        mtoto wa form 2 anakaa ni kama ako na mtoto form 1. Kama Balotelli nikajiuliza 
                        “Why always me?”
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Yaani mtoto amemea double Ds akaona aanze kupata vitamin D mapema 
                        hivi badala ya kusoma, huyo hata KCSE kitu una expect apate ni D tu… 
                        I was very D-isappointed . smh! Anakuliwa kama pesa za CDF! Nikachungulia 
                        nje nikaona wamatha wa mushene walikuwa na committee nje ya ploti so 
                        nikasho dem akule vako nikifikiria vile ntamtoa hiyo ploti. Kuleta dem 
                        mansion haikuwangi shida, shida ni kumtoa. Arif ni kama alichukulia serious 
                        ile msemo ya “Mtoto akililia wembe mpe” akacheza kama Otile Brown akaonyesha 
                        vile yeye ndio anakata wembe… but badala ya “Baby Love” akapita na a baby for 
                        love. smh! Hii issue ilikuwa na weight but nikajipata nimekonda, nilikuwa na 
                        slim chances za ku avoid jela juu ya kuwa thick headed kusaidiana mansion. 
                        Kama weighing scale hii issue ilikuwa na uzito sana! Wanaume wengine tukikatia 
                        madem huku nje, arif alijifanya kichinjio akachinjia mwanafunzi coz ako na nyama… 
                        anataka kupea mtoto wa wenyewe mtoto mwingine.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Hii haikuwa date, ilikuwa Baby’s 
                        Day Out! Huyu akaeza shika mimba umpate maternity ward akizaa, hiyo ndio huitwa 
                        child labour! Mtoto wa huyo mtoto badala ya ku celebrate birthday hiyo inafaa 
                        iitwe labour day! Utoto ni kukatia mtoto!! Kidogo kidogo niki debate na akili 
                        nikaskia mtu akigonga mlango, nikaenda kufungua mlango bila kufikiria… alas! 
                        Jirani flani huwa mtiaji alikuwa amesimama hapo na chief na karao wawili wa AP. 
                        Alafu si unajua kawaida ya polisi wa AP; arrest first, ask questions later. 
                        Nikabebwa juu juu design nilikuwa na tippy toe badala ya kutembea. Askari wa 
                        AP si mlango so huwezi bishana nao. Kama Desiigner nika-Panda Landcruiser 
                        nikajua hii husimama stage moja pekee, police station. Badala ya kufunga pingu 
                        za maisha nikafungwa pingu za jela kwasababu nimepatwa na mtoto wa serikali.. 
                        makosa! Nikaambiwa kitu mwanafunzi anafaa kupigwa nayo ni kiboko tu sio kupigwa 
                        mti, kwa akili yangu nikajiambia labda huyo dem aliambia arif “Nipe mtihani” but 
                        arif akaskia “Nipe mti honey.” Who knows! Arif aliona dem ana uzito kama 
                        hipopotomus akaona huyo ndio kiboko yao
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Mapenzi mwanafunzi anafaa kujua ni agape love peke yake... kama wild life 
                        reserve, viboko zikanitembelea. Nikawasho waulize huyo mwanafunzi alikuwa 
                        na nani coz mimi ni innocent bystander tu

                        Dem akapanguzwa mashavu kidogo akataja arif, place wali meet, namba yake ya 
                        simu then mimi nikapewa option, nipeleke chief na hao karao wa AP kwa arif 
                        ama niwekwe ndani kama accomplice. Kwa akili nilikuwa naona option mbili, 
                        kukunia kwa ndoo ama kukunia kwa choo, kukuliwa na kunguni ama kukuliwa na 
                        wahuni, bedsitter ya 6 by 6 ama jela ya 4 by 6; nikakumbuka east or west home 
                        is best. In short; arif aliwacha bibi yake akaenda kuwa bibi ya wanaume wenzake 
                        hapo stenje. Mtoto wa shule D anafaa kupata ni Discipline, na hiyo ndio alipata 
                        hapo stenje. Mtoto kama hana ID then huyo hana IDea, achana na yeye! Usimdunge 
                        penisillin mdunge pencil, usimu-wish safe sex mu-wish success, mpatie mtihani 
                        afanye sio mti honey… these are my two cents I hope they make sense.

                    <p>
                        Caleb, 6.2" tall, dark and a body of a southern Nilotic god, 
                        was my sister's workmate at a certain bank in Nairobi CBD and i 
                        had known him since I was sixteen years old.Whenever I had to go 
                        for pocket money from my sister she would take me to the back 
                        office and as she finished up whatever she was doing, Caleb would 
                        ask me all sorts of questions about school.. I loved listening 
                        to his baritone and I always stammered due to the effect he had on me.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Three years later we coincidentally met at Nairobi Java house and 
                        soon we were catching up like old friends and surprisingly that 
                        shy school girl had vanished and the vixen in me wanted to come out 
                        and play.We exchanged numbers and soon we were hooking up every 
                        weekend for a drink or two.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        The sexual tension between us was palpable and as we got to know 
                        each other better it started becoming unbearable but the problem 
                        was that I was conflicted. I was 19 and the only experience in 
                        bedminton I had was one, a few months earlier ,on my birthday,when 
                        i lost my virginity to a useless idiot.Up to date that is the most 
                        tasteless sex i have ever had. Caleb was 31 years old and I was 
                        afraid he would laugh at my inexperience and naivety.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        One rainy Friday, Caleb called me as usual and we met at our 
                        favorite pub. As I was having my cocktail he told me he wanted 
                        to take me to his place for dinner and dear pinkies, I clearly 
                        knew what he meant , this was it .He looked at me with a smile 
                        playing on his lips and I nodded my reply.What the hec! I thought 
                        to myself , I might as well get this over with once and for all.We 
                        left the pub and got in his car,drove to the next street and he 
                        alighted outside a chemist and went inside. I didn't have to be 
                        a genius to know what he had gone to buy,meanwhile i kept my eyes 
                        glued outside my window pretending to be very interested in the 
                        city's rush hour madness. No one talked during the whole ride 
                        and soon we were in his apartment.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        The minute we stepped in Caleb pinned me on the wall and kissed 
                        me passionately and pinkies let me tell you that kiss was the 
                        perfect kiss,demanding and yet not intrusive, passionate ,urgent 
                        yet gentle. His body was pressed on me and I could feel his 
                        manhood throbbing just near my center . My body shook with wanton 
                        desire...I wanted this man, no, I needed him and as the kiss 
                        deepened every fiber of my being was in fire. He pulled back and 
                        looked into my eyes.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        " I want to make you dinner but I want to make love to you first.What do you want babe?". 
                        He asked me .
                        " Caleb...I have only done this once before... I don't know how ... " I stammered.
                        His hands went to my back and slowly unzipped my dress and slid it down my shoulders 
                        and let it fall to the floor. He took my hand and led me to his bedroom,sat me on 
                        the edge of the bed and knelt down in front of me .He parted my thighs and kissed 
                        them gently and my trembling resumed as his kisses slowly came further up.
                        " Don't be scared...I will not hurt you" He whispered.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        I nodded and he proceeded with his exploration. His lips finally 
                        struck home and he flipped my panties to the side and kissed my 
                        center. Pleasure like I have never experienced ran through my 
                        whole body and I moaned and called the gods. He laid me down and 
                        I lifted my hips as he removed my flimsy panties already wet with 
                        my desire. He parted my thighs and proceeded to lick me again and 
                        oh boy ,this man knew the right places to softly bite and lick and 
                        touch and within a few minutes I got my first orgasm .I screamed 
                        with pleasure and pushed his head willing him to go deeper and he 
                        did, dear gods...I had tasted heaven and it was pure delight.A 
                        maelstrom sent by the god Eros himself rocked me and I came again.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Caleb got out and stripped quickly and my eyes feasted on him and 
                        grew big when I saw his erect manhood. dear gods...how was that 
                        thing going to fit in me? He smiled and got the condoms and got out 
                        one.He got back in bed and knelt between my legs which were rapidly 
                        closing up in fear .
                        "Hey ,don't panic.. I won't hurt you. If it hurts I will stop". He 
                        assured me as he gently kissed my thighs again .
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        He came up and kissed my lips,and I could taste myself in that kiss. 
                        He put his hands on my back and expertly unclasped my bra and in an 
                        instant his mouth was on my nipples. Pleasure burst through my veins 
                        and I could hardly breath.He traced his hands down south and his 
                        fingers found my clit and gently rubbed me and teased me,rubbed my 
                        lips as i arched my back with lust. He tore the wrapper and sheathed 
                        himself and he lifted my legs on his shoulder and slowly entered me, 
                        the condoms were the studded ones and I could feel every inch of me 
                        being grazed deliciously.Soon I was on the verge of exploding again as 
                        i felt him reach the deepest part in me and I hit cloud 9 again. My 
                        muscles clenched his member as my juices poured and he whispered his 
                        love for me as his thrusts became more powerful and demanding finally 
                        he let go with a roar. I felt his d*ck throb inside me as he reached his orgasm.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        I lowered my legs and wrapped them on his back and we remained in a 
                        sweaty embrace. I did not want this to end and he whispered to me . 
                        "Next round you will be on top" I smiled with anticipation of what was to come next....
                        The rain continued falling outside as this gentle giant proceeded to show 
                        me the carnal pleasures I had only read in books.
                        Dinner was forgotten until 1 a.m.:)

                <h3 class="story__title">Things we've done for money</h3>
                <p class="story__story">
                    <p>
                        Many years ago i was approached by a certain Tanzanian businessman 
                        with a deal i could not refuse. For 500k each i was to avail a few 
                        trailers to him, the trucks then drive to kisumu to load ethanol f
                        or export from Spectre International. After loading the trucks drive 
                        to Namanga and eventually enter TZ after clearing. We then head to 
                        Moshi through Arusha and at Moshi ndio mchezo inaanza, the number 
                        plate is changed complete with a new insurance, sticker.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Very important, over night we had to drive through Njia Panda, Marangu, 
                        Tarakea, Loitoktok, Emali and back to Nairobi before dawn using panya routes. 
                        Truck yenyewe ukiangalia then ilikuwa kama mpya. After a few trips you 
                        change the oil and brake linings hata kama hazijaisha. New tyres always, 
                        and after wear and tear kidogo unauzia mkamba unaweka zingine mpya. The 
                        cost of a breakdown before dawn was incomprehensible on the kenyan side 
                        as it meant dealing with unpredictable police after a shift change na 
                        macho mingi ya watu. Yaani umepea wa usiku pesa sasa itabidi you 
                        negotiate again na wa mchana who were usually not on the know.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        The drive back to Kenya we were being escorted by 2 chase cars one 
                        infront and another behind. Always loaded with police and KRA money 
                        coz coming back was magendo. Wadau pesa inabebwa na chase cars was 
                        alot coz each roadblock the normal rate was 100k. Kwa roadblock no 
                        stopping unakuta everything has been sorted by the chase cars wewe 
                        tu nikuenda. Not forgetting in each truck you are given around 100k 
                        non refundable ya mfuko in case the chase cars are held up and you 
                        have to deal with the police yourself which was a rare occurance. 
                        After offloading in Nairobi the cycle is repeated.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Hata kama ni wewe ungekataa 500k for a weeks work. Expenses haumalizi 
                        mia? Did the said business for almost a year kwanza one December i can 
                        recall we were doing 2 trips a week. Yaani nakumbuka one christmas and 
                        new years day nikingangana usiku na trailer as everyone else was at 
                        home celebrating.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Unfortunately/fortunately, things went south when a rival business 
                        man (ethanol importer) snitched on us. At mlolongo around 3am 
                        tulikuta umati wa around 50 policemen na wazito wa KRA gari zikashikwa.
                        That is when i came to know the true owner of the business. As an 
                        aspiring politician then, he came usiku to negotiate with the police 
                        but all was in vain because the press had been tipped. Kumbe i had 
                        been dealing with a now current mzito in Government using his proxies. 
                        Funnily news of the nab never made it to any local dailies as the press 
                        was "sorted". Right now the mzito is being touted as the best thing since 
                        sliced bread.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Anyway my trucks spent the better part of the year ndani before

                    <p>
                        It's another slow day as our economy keeps getting tougher.Journey 
                        with me through a funny incident, which makes me laugh whenever I 
                        remember it.I hope you remember Caleb from my first Hekaya.
                        It came to pass that Caleb's grandpa died a few months later 
                        and he requested that I accompany him to the burial in Turbo,Uasin Gishu 
                        county. I agreed gladly since the only thing I could offer at the 
                        moment was my companionship. We traveled at night with the common 
                        Eldoret Express bus (The buses were still new then) and oh what 
                        great fun we had. As soon as we left Nairobi behind ,Caleb told me 
                        to cover my laps with a kikoi. I could tell he was up to something 
                        naughty by the way his voice dropped an octave lower and a smile 
                        played on my lips as i remembered a previous episode we had shared 
                        in the most unusual place.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        I was wearing a dress since we were heading to shagz and I wanted 
                        to arrive looking like the decent girl that I am. (yes,go ahead and 
                        laugh). As soon as i covered my thighs, Caleb hands crept under the 
                        kikoi and slid my dress up so slowly and caressed my thighs...within 
                        no time he had hit me dead center, his long finger entering me 
                        while his thumb played with my clit and lips, needless to say, 
                        soon I was gushing wet and I was biting my lower lip to stifle 
                        my moans of pleasure. " Hush love. Do not make a sound." He 
                        whispered with a grin. His fingers worked on me as the other 
                        passengers slept away and soon I had slid down on my sit and hoisted 
                        one leg on his thighs with careless abandon. My gods...the joy and 
                        pleasure I felt that night in the quiet bus was epic. Eventually my 
                        desire was sated and Caleb wiped me gently with my wet wipes,re arranged 
                        my panties and dress and held me in his arms, and lulled me to sleep.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Soon we were in Turbo and I was received by Caleb's family with joy and 
                        warmth despite the fact that I was a mungikiress. The following morning 
                        mourners arrived in droves and the solemn ceremony went on well.When the 
                        funeral was over Caleb and his boy cousins went to turbo town to drink 
                        and I was left with the ladies,cooking supper and helping out where I 
                        can. I didn't mind being left alone with the family.I was happy,because 
                        in short,by bringing me home, Caleb had declared that I was the girl 
                        she was going to marry.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Soon I retired to bed to the room assigned to me and since the place 
                        was full I was sharing the room with other relatives. At around 
                        midnight a message beeped on my phone.
                        I need you now. Come outside.?
                        My heart pounded with excitement and I crept out of the room in 
                        my nightie and kikoi. I met my love outside and the moonlight 
                        bathed us with its celestial glow as he devoured my lips with 
                        his hunger. The amazing kiss ended and he led me through the 
                        chilly night to an old hut which was in the far end of the compound.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        "shhhh." He whispered as he softly opened the door. We crept into a 
                        small room with two metal beds and on one bed lay an old man the 
                        age of @FieldMarshal CouchP snoring like @Meria Mata or @amun truck 
                        going up a hill.I stifled a laugh as I whispered my query as to who 
                        the old man was. " My grandfather's old classmate". He replied.
                    </p>
                    <p> 

                        We got into the bed and it creaked under our weight . The snoring 
                        stopped abruptly and we froze. We lay there barely breathing and 
                        eventually the octogenarian snores resumed and reached a high tempo. 
                        Caleb undressed slowly and soon he was gloriously naked. I totally 
                        refused to remove my nightie in fear of being caught. He took my 
                        hand and led it to his phallus which was already hard and demanding. 
                        I caressed it with my hand,playing him as he did in the bus..rubbing 
                        him up and down and softly caressing his privates. His d*ck throbbed 
                        in my grasp and his breath became uneven. "God ,I want you so bad babe".
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        He whispered in my ear as he kissed me and his hand hiked my nightie 
                        all the way up to to the neck and he caressed my boobs making my nipples 
                        hard with desire.Within a moment his other hand had already removed my 
                        panties and threw them on the floor and his hand cupped my mons pubis. 
                        I shuddered with desire as the foreplay continued, our gasps and moans 
                        covered by the old man's snores which were becoming louder.Suddenly 
                        Caleb hauled me up and sat me on his erect member and I impaled myself 
                        slowly. Every sweet delicious inch of him fit me like a glove and once 
                        again,like countless times before, we were one.I rode my man ,winding 
                        my waist ,round and round, up and down.He put his hands on my waist 
                        and lifted me up and down...The bed creaked, the old man snored, 
                        desired flared and sizzled around us.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Caleb lifted me again and placed 
                        me lying on my side,my back on his stomach and his hard d*ck throbbing 
                        on my ass. He lifted my leg and led his d*ck into my cunt and pounded 
                        into me. I lay there enjoying it and returning his thrusts with my own..
                        moaning and whispering the names of my gods. The old man snores continued 
                        and I hit my orgasms again and again, finally with one mighty thrust Caleb 
                        came and I opened my eyes halfway, and froze as my gaze fell on the old 
                        man's face and saw his eyes wide open in the dimly lit room,his mouth opening 
                        and closing with a fake snore, and a certain familiar movement on the man's 
                        torso made me guess what he was up to " What the f**k!... The old dinosaur 
                        is wanking!"I thought to myself.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Panic and embarrassment consumed me and I slowly pulled my nightdress 
                        down and turned around and whispered to my love that I had to go back 
                        to my room. I fled out and went to the main house wondering how I was 
                        going to explain myself in the morning.
                        Morning came and as we were having breakfast the old man came in. I 
                        choked on my tea as he greeted all of us by hand and i could had 
                        sworn our handshake lasted longer than necessary.I fled to the kitchen 
                        and avoided him until we left.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        On the bus ride home I suddenly remembered that i left my panties 
                        in the hut. I told Caleb and he laughed as he told me the old man 
                        had told him to go collect something in the room as we were leaving 
                        and he pulled out my white panties from his jeans' pocket.

                <p class="story__story">
                    <p>
                        Talkers, Caleb was gone. I sat there in my room on the cold floor 
                        with nothing on but one of his old tee shirt , It was my favorite 
                        tee coz he had given it to me. It was his favorite and I still wear 
                        it occasionally as much as it has aged now.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        I sat there,curled up in a corner, not feeling the cold seep through 
                        my ass and I moaned for my man..I cannot recall how long I sat there 
                        enduring waves upon waves of crippling pain. I cursed the gods for 
                        this mockery! How could the goddess Atropos cut the thread of my 
                        Caleb's life?Overwhelming grief and fury consumed me and my voice 
                        was hoarse with screaming,my eyes swollen and my head aching...an 
                        almost empty bottle of whiskey lay there besides me...Even alcohol 
                        could not numb the pain.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        The previous 48 hours continuously played in my mind like a broken 
                        record...The awful call made by a good samaritan who had picked up 
                        his phone from the mangled wreck of his car and redialed the last 
                        call made,My number.....Me, rushing to Guru Nanak hospital with my 
                        pajamas and an overcoat....The gurney,packed in the narrow corridor 
                        with a sheet covering someone, Approaching it and recognizing my 
                        gentle giant's shoe from his dangling foot, The policeman slowly 
                        uncovering the sheet and the agony that tore me to shreds when I 
                        saw the severely mutilated face of my Nilotic god...Then blackness 
                        and finally awakening on a hospital bed. The nightmare played on 
                        and on in my head and i whimpered on the floor..I finally crawled 
                        into my bed and willed myself to forget him.... but i couldn't.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        My thoughts went back to one of the happiest moment we shared two 
                        weeks before the grim reaper swung his scythe .Promises had been made. 
                        Promises had been broken.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        ********************************<br>
                        We had gone to Kilifi county for a weekend getaway. One of Caleb's 
                        friend had inherited an old shack from his folks in a secluded place 
                        called Roka Maweni. We arrived at dusk , took our supplies from the 
                        cars and set up our new humble aboard. Soon we were partying over a 
                        campfire under the moonlight,with the sound of the ocean waves crushing 
                        on the cliffs...It was a beautiful night. Due to the long drive from 
                        Nairobi,we all got tired and retired early.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        A gentle shake awoke me early at dawn,it was almost 6 a.m and Caleb 
                        kissed my neck and told me to get up.
                        '' Babe wake up...I want to show you something, wear your swimsuit."
                        I hurriedly woke up and went through my luggage, wore my bikini and tied 
                        a sarong wrap. I joined Caleb outside the shack and his eyes lit up as 
                        he took in my sight. A cheeky smile played on his lips (and we all know 
                        what that means by now)as he took my hand and led me down a rocky,bushy path.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Our pal's shack was nearly on the edge of a cliff and soon I saw the 
                        majestic ocean , dark and calm and gradually the sky lit up ushering 
                        a new dawn. We laughed like teens and hurried down the steep rocky 
                        cliff and reached an isolated beach.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        We took in the awesome sight,gentle waves lapped on our feet and 
                        the morning birds chirped above the cliff. Caleb kissed me passionately 
                        and I removed his khaki shirt. He dropped his pants and he stood there 
                        gloriously naked before me. I took in his majestic sight erect and 
                        proud and my blood turned hot with desire.

                        "Let's go for a swim!" He proclaimed.

                        "Are you nuts?" I laughingly asked.

                        "Nope. I forgot to carry my trunks".He replied as he untied my 
                        sarong and threw it on top of his clothes.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        He took my hand and led me into the sea. The water was amazingly 
                        warm and after awhile we had reached into a deeper place and the 
                        water was just above my waist...Caleb turned me around and I was in 
                        his embrace,crushing me to his chest.He slowly kissed my lips, I 
                        opened my mouth and the kiss became deeper and hotter. The gentle 
                        waves pushed us further into the water and soon I was floating,I 
                        wrapped my legs around his waist and I could feel his manhood poking 
                        me between my legs. We kissed more, His hands caressed my boobs and he 
                        removed them from their harness one by one and played with my nipples..
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He bent over and took each one in turn into his mouth.,softly sucking 
                        and biting them. Pleasure spread through out my body, Sweet Mother of 
                        God...I ached for him and pressed his head on my bosom. His hand slowly 
                        travelled down and found my pu**y , he nudged my flimsy bikini aside and 
                        he rubbed my pu**y lips and clit in turn , I moaned as I clung on him for 
                        my dear life. His d*ck replaced his hands and he slid it up and down my 
                        pu**y until I was on the verge of exploding.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        " I want you now." I begged him.

                        And he finally slid inside me...oh the pleasure I felt as he slowly 
                        filled me up. His hands cupped my bum and the slight waves helped him 
                        Bob me up and down. Our lips met for a kiss as his d*ck slipped in and 
                        out of my cunt,my legs wrapped tightly on his back.My wave of pleasure 
                        spiralled up and my body trembled as I exploded in his arms.

                        "I love you babe" He proclaimed as he reached his climax too.
                        " I want you to be my wife and the mother of my children." He harshly 
                        whispered as he spilled his seed deep inside my womb.

                    <p>

                        Tears of joy and pleasure rolled down my cheeks and I nodded my head...
                        His fingers reached my clit and rubbed it as he was still inside me and 
                        once again I exploded fiercely .


                        "Yes! Yes!I am yours to have and to hold forever . I shouted to the morning sun.

                        He held me tight until my tremors subsided..and I lay on his chest as we 
                        swam lazily. We went to the shore finally,he dressed up and I tied my 
                        sarong and we sat there on the rocky beach making plans as we watched 
                        the fishermen come to shore with their catch.
                        " I will love you forever and a day." He said as we got up and headed 
                        back with a big fish for lunch.

                        I curled in the bed and wailed some more for my dear sweet Caleb. I 
                        called my gods to take me to too but they were deaf to my pleas.
